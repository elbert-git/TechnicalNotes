### NFTs

non fungible token

* non fungible: unique in value, impossible to trade for for equivalent value.
* token: a unique id(like web auth tokens)

It's a verifiable token/receipt to say you own a particular item.

### Why buy them,

Bragging rights for now really.

it's a way into a community, a social status

### Where do the trades happen

Mostly on opensea. it's becoming defacto locaiton for trading these nfts

Though' you do need an metamask wallet to trade. it's like your digital crypto wallet i guess

### what is metamask

 seems to be a crypto coin wallet

### setting up the metamask

you need a seed phrase. that's your password.

and uh.. thats all you need. this is permanent and lets you access everything

so... you're kind of the master of your own privacy and security here.

### funding your metamask

you need to put in coins in your wallet so that it can you know do things in the web3

just use coinbase

### Ethereum

seems to be the first class citizen of metamask

### uniswap

you can trade tokens here. like eth to bitcoin, or shibacoin

### why nfts

* collections like trading cards
* game assets??? not likely
* DAO, i think is like patreon but they have a say in where the project they invest in goes
* some weird investing ARG

**metamask**

* merkle trees
  * hashes: takes an input data and spews out random string of a set length no matter the data
    * allows you to verify 2 elements the input data and hash key
    * basically allows to verify if an output really came from an input;
    * you can verify input and output from this. 
  * merkle trees are just a nest of hashes
    * allows you to verify if anything has changed in a group of files
    * this is actually how git works. how they verify what changes in a whole chain of files.
* Blockchain
  * is just a merkle "chain"
    * a bunch of blocks the can be verifiably traced back to the original block. 
    * since you can prove that one chain comes after the other
  * The bitcoin ledger "chain"
    * the bitcoin blockchain is just a set of recorded transactions chained one after the other. 
    * and each can be verified to be tied from the first block.
    * Validity of ledger
      * "proof of work"
        * to add a block to the blockchain. you need to guess a random hash.
        * this is a "proof" of work
        * it's fair since it's random so no one group gets a big say on what gets added.
      * bitcoin miners are the ones who race to guess this hash.
        * if you guess it. you can add your block to the chain. and you get more coin
        * the coin is the incentive to verify transactions
          * this whole process is called "mining"
      * How does verify the true chain of blocks
        * everybody is incentivized to verify the transactions.
        * you'd have to go against the every other miner to spoof it. which is mathematically and logistically infeasible.
* The ethereum block chain
  * Instead of a list of transactions like the bitcoin blockchain. the ethereum is essentially a large decentralized database. 
  * everyone can agree on the state of the data and a set of function to call to manipulate the data.
  * the functions are called smart contracts. which is just a public IFTTT(if this then that).
  * this allows people to create more trusted functionalities or "contracts" with each other. if they are just manipulating data.
